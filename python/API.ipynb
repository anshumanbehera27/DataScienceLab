    "2. Reach: APIs let you create layers in apps in order to distribute information to different audiences.\n",
    "3. Customization: Furthermore, it can serve as a solution to create different experiences for users, letting protocols, functions, and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",
    "4. Efficiency: When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels  simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",
